abstract:
  Investigations were carried out to evaluate the profitability of an alternative method of pest control - neem seed extract (NSE) at Bida (9.06N and 5.59E) during the 1994 and 1995 cropping seasons.  The results obtained were compared with the performance of a conventional agrochemical-nuvacron.  Results obtained show that there were significant difference between the yields obtained from the two control methods at 5% level of significance.  Also 3.33% w/v of NSE and 0.2% v/v of nuvacron gave best yields of 712.60 kg/ha and  1165 kg/ha respectively.  These results translate to gross margin of N10,993.19 and N19,637.99 respectively.  It is recommended that each farm family should own at least one neem tree.
