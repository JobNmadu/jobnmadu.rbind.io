abstract: Adaptive capacity is the ability of the farmer to adjust his farm plans and programmes in the face of emerging risks, constraints and currently available information. In this study, the various constraints faced by International Fund for Agricultural Development-Value Chain Development Programme’s farmers (IFAD-VCDP) in North Central Nigeria in adapting to climate change challenges were investigated. Study Design A multi-stage sampling technique was employed in the selection of respondents. The study was conducted in Benue and Niger States of Nigeria in 2018. Data were collected from a total of 483 respondents using interview schedule and questionnaire. The data were analysed using exploratory (principal component analysis) and confirmatory (structural equation modelling) factor analysis. The results of the analysis revealed the significant constraints the farmers faced in order to improve their adaptive capacity to climate change which were institutional and technical (49.45%) and climate information (26.62%) constraints, although the factors differ slightly within the two states under study. In Benue State, institutional (31.26%), personal (14.63%), land and farm inputs (12.54%) and population (11.73%) while in Niger State, public and institutional (22.34%), land and farm inputs (14.78%), and personal (10.75) were the constraints to adaptive capacity.  These constraints make it harder to plan and implement adaptation actions by restricting the variety and effectiveness of options available to the farmers to improve their productivity and cope with the vagaries of climate change. It was therefore recommended that government and NGOs should intensify efforts on public, institutional, educational and climate policies, assist in increasing the adaptive capacity of the farmers in order to employ more adaptation measures, land governance systems should be strengthened in Nigeria to provide tenure security for all, financial institutions should help facilitate access to credit by farmers and assist in making reliable climate information accessible to all farmers.

abstract: Although a number of studies have been carried out on climate change but the levels of vulnerability of farmers and factors affecting vulnerability of the farmers to this topical issue have not been sufficiently determined in the study area, giving rise to this study. The study was conducted in Benue and Niger States involving 483 IFAD-VCDP farmers. A total of 500 questionnaires were distributed, however only 96.6% were completed and returned. As such the data analysis was based on 483 farmers under International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) – Value Chain Development Programme (VCDP) from 10 participating Local Government of the two States. Both primary and secondary data were utilized for this study. The primary data were collected via questionnaire administered by trained enumerators, while the secondary data were collected from Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NIMET). The data were analysed using descriptive statistics, vulnerability index and Beta regression model. The farmers were aware of eighteen climate change variables with assorted levels of occurrences. There was moderate vulnerable to climate change in the study area necessitating the need of enhanced awareness and capacity building to upgrade their homegrown adaptation strategies. Poverty status (3.0) was found to increase vulnerability while adaptive capacity (-23.8), age (-0.1), education (-0.7), gender (-2.8), distance to market (-0.1), livestock ownership (-0.4), social amenities (-1.9), total livelihood activities (-2.4) and membership of association (-3.8) decreased vulnerability by the percentages indicated in parenthesis. The study therefore recommended that the level of literacy among farm households and availability of social amenities should be critical issues when formulating climate adaptation policies and developmental issues. Government and NGOs should install processes that can enhance the adaptive capacity of the farmers.
