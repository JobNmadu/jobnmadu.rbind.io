    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p class="pub-abstract" itemprop="text">This study examined the attitude and constraints of small scale farmers in Paikoro Local Government Area towards agricultural insurance-taking in the past and their willingness in the future. The data collected from 75 farmers, were analysed using descriptive statistics and chi-square. The findings indicate that about 65% of the respondents had more than 5 years of farming experience, a good development but which has made the respondents to abandon education at secondary level. It was also found that most of the farmers (84%) did not insure their farms with NAIC voluntarily. About 60% of the farmers claim ignorance as the constraints to insurance-taking, a situation which was likely attributable to the low level of education of the respondents. It was also found that the extent of awareness is a very important factor to successful insurance-taking. It is recommended that stakeholder sessions on confidence building on agricultural insurance as well as sensitizing the respondents of the benefits of well-educated farming population be undertaken. It is also recommended that farmers should be merged to 20-30ha for economy of scale. There is also need to establish a continuing education system to assist in transformation from traditional to commercial level, making insurance-taking imperative.</p>
